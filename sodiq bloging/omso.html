            <p>I am <b>Sodiq</b> by name, I have been trying to be a <i>programer</i> since I have been chasing admission into higher institution, i introducd that to my Dad then, the person asked us to pay fifty thousand Naira then(2013), but my dad was thinking that it will affect my focus in school and that was how it ended</p>
            <p>But it <del> so painful</del> to see what programming turns to today, so I regret missing the opportunity back then, because the <ins>money</ins> and <ins>time</ins> at this stage is kind of not affordable if the dedication is not that strong, because someone have sacrifice a lot more than then now</p>
